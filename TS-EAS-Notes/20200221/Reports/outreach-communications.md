# Scope and role of the Outreach and Communications team
The scope/role of this team represents a refactored charge for the former Documentation team. The focus of the Outreach and Communications team is to promote broader awareness of TS-EASâ€™ activities and its work plans, across a range of key stakeholders and audiences.

In addition to coordinating closely with other TS-EAS teams, the Outreach and Communications team would liaise with the Encoded Archival Standards (EAS) Section leadership on communications, education, and outreach plans.

# Work completed between August 2019-February 2020

* With TS-EAS, we formalized the charge for the Outreach and Communications team, launched the group, and confirmed the team membership.
* Established team workspace and communications channel (Google Group list, Slack)
* Hosted initial planning meeting in January; scheduled monthly meetings
* Began to scope a draft statement for posting to the EAD and EAC-CPF websites regarding translated tag libraries and application guidelines
* Started on work to host an initial, pilot webinar on April 17th. The webinar will highlight TS-EAS' workplan and priorities for 2020. We'll plan to host 2 sessions -- one optimized for US timezones, one optimized for Europe timezones. Each session will be 30 minutes (15 minute presentation, followed by 15 minute question and answer portion). The April 17th webinar times:
-	3:00pm CET / 6:00am PT / 7:00am MT / 9:00am ET
-	6:00pm CET / 9:00am PT / 10:00am MT / 12:00pm ET
* Prior to April, we will conduct early testing of SAA's Zoom to ensure that it'll work for our purposes -- and will create a checklist of pre- and post-webinar steps.	We're also going to work on draft messaging and announcements, to send through key channels channels (e.g., EAS Section, EAD listserv, and other venues).
* Following on the webinar, we will prepare a write-up of TS-EAS' workplan and priorities for the year -- and distribute that message through the same key channels.
* Secured 10 minute timeslots for TS-EAS updates at the following Section meetings, at the SAA 2020 conference: Description Section + Metadata and Digital Object Section (combined); EAS Section; and Collection Management Tools Section + Acquisition and Appraisal Section (combined).
