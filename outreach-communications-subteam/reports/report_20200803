TS-EAS Outreach and Communications team
Semi-Annual Activity Report (January-August 2020)

==

Scope and role of the Outreach and Communications team
The scope/role of this team represents a refactored charge for the former Documentation team. The focus of the Outreach and Communications team is to promote broader awareness of TS-EASâ€™ activities and its work plans, across a range of key stakeholders and audiences.

In addition to coordinating closely with other TS-EAS teams, the Outreach and Communications team would liaise with the Encoded Archival Standards (EAS) Section leadership on communications, education, and outreach plans.

* Hosted initial planning meeting in January 2020; scheduled monthly meetings.
* Updated TS-EAS pages on the SAA microsite vis-a-vis GitHub. 
* Prepared a context statement regarding non-English translations of EAS tag libraries, posted to EAC-CPF website (in-process of posting to EAD website).
* Hosted a pilot webinar (two sessions) on 2020-04-17, highlighting TS-EAS and the group's priorities for this year.  Posted video to SAA's YouTube channel; slides and Q&A summary on GitHub. We had 62 attendees in first session; 100 in second session. We exceeded capacity in both cases, after we got started and began recording.

Prepared a set of resources and documentation for the Outreach and Communications team and hosts/presenters (webinar preparation planning document, Zoom checklist, sample slide deck, sample announcement verbiage, etc.) to streamline processes. Relayed feedback to SAA regarding the need for licensing Zoom Webinar features, to more effectively support TS-EAS and other SAA groups with webinar-based outreach and communications initiatives.
* In-process of scripting and developing brief tutorial videos for posting to SAA's YouTube, and also for linking or embedding in the TS-EAS Handbook, for the fall/winter timeframe. The first two tutorials will cover 1) the EAS revision process overview (major vs. minor), and 2) processes for suggesting updates to EAS schemas, via GitHub. 
* In-process of scoping content for two additional potential tutorial videos: 1) using simple strategies and free tools for validating and updating EAD files, and 2) introduction to EAC-CPF.
* In-process of identifying topics for next webinar, for the fall/winter timeframe: 1) EAC-CPF schema revision, 2) update on Records in Context, and/or 3) EAD3 implementation case studies.
* Coordinated with EAS Section, Description Section, and Collection Management Tools Section for TS-EAS updates at SAA 2020 virtual annual conference.
