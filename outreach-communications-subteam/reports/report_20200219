# TS-EAS Outreach and Communications team
## Semi-Annual Activity Report (October 2020-February 2021)


## Scope and role of the Outreach and Communications team
The scope/role of this team represents a refactored charge for the former Documentation team. The focus of the Outreach and Communications team is to promote broader awareness of TS-EAS’ activities and its work plans, across a range of key stakeholders and audiences.

In addition to coordinating closely with other TS-EAS teams, the Outreach and Communications team would liaise with the Encoded Archival Standards (EAS) Section leadership on communications, education, and outreach plans.
